### This repository includes some methods to process images or videos from IR camera.

---

1. **IRvideo**: This file folder is mainly used to process videosðŸŒµ

---

2. **IRimage**: This file folder is mainly used to process images.
- *boundary_image.m*: segment objects by find the boundary of the object.

*preprocess.m*: Evaluate the performance of different preprocess methods.

*postprocess.m*: Evaluate the performance of different postprocess methods.

*overallprocess.m*: The overall procedure to preprocess and segment the IR images. The results includes:

 1. all the processed images
 2. damages' area

*area_account.m*: To get the damages' area.

*gcul.m*: Calculate the gradient on the edge of damages.

*gradient_main.m*: To process the pictures like.
