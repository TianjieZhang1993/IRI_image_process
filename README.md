### The purpose of this repository is to process the IR_images obtained from civil infrastructures, analyze and transfer the results to what engineers and decision-makers needed.


#### Images --> Segment -->Damage density index -->application

An new index was proposed to quantify the defects intensity.

 **DamageDensity**: This file foler is to calculate the index "damage density" in a IR imageðŸŒ³

Framework to calculate the damage density in infrastructure

*preprocess.m*: Evaluate the performance of different preprocess methods.

*postprocess.m*: Evaluate the performance of different postprocess methods.

*overallprocess.m*: The overall procedure to preprocess and segment the IR images. The results includes:

 1. all the processed images
 2. damages' area

*area_account.m*: To get the damages' area.

*gcul.m*: Calculate the gradient on the edge of damages.

Results of some lab tests:

It was shown that the index damage density has a positive linear relationship (the correlation coefficient is 0.94) with total
volumes of the subsurface voids in the detection area compared to traditional image segmentation methods.

**The image process method:**

**A demo:**

 **IRimage_matlab**+**IRimage_opencv**: These two file folders are mainly used to process and segment images.

#### Mainly included three main kinds of image processing methods:

- *boundary_image.m*: segment objects **by find the boundary of the object**.

- *K_means1.m*:  segment objects **by clustering**.
