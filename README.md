### This repository includes some methods to process images or videos from IR camera.

---

1. **IRvideo**: This file folder is mainly used to process videosðŸŒµ
2. **IRimage**: This file folder is mainly used to process images.
- *boundary_image.m*: segment objects by find the boundary of the object.

3. **DamageDensity**: This file foler is to calculate the index "damage density" in a IR imageðŸŒ³

*preprocess.m*: Evaluate the performance of different preprocess methods.

*overallprocess.m*: The overall procedure to preprocess and segment the IR images. The results includes:

 1. all the processed images
 2. damages' area
