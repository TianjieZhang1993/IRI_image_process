### This repository includes some methods to process images or videos from IR camera.

---

1. **IRvideo**: This file folder is mainly used to process videosðŸŒµ
2. **IRimage**: This file folder is mainly used to process images.
- *boundary_image.m*: segment objects by find the boundary of the object.
